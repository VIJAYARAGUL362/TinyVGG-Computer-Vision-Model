# Fashion MNIST Classification with PyTorch

A deep learning project implementing three different neural network architectures to classify Fashion MNIST dataset images, progressing from basic fully connected networks to convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

> 🎓 **Learning Project**: Built while following Daniel Bourke's ["Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning in a Day. Literally."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ikDlimN6A) course on YouTube.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project explores image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset using PyTorch, implementing and comparing three different model architectures:

1. **Model 01** - Basic Neural Network (CPU)
2. **Model 02** - Neural Network with ReLU activation (GPU)
3. **Model 03** - TinyVGG Convolutional Neural Network (GPU)

## 🎯 Results

| Model | Architecture | Accuracy | Training Time | Device |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|--------|
| Model 01 | Basic NN | ~85% | Baseline | CPU |
| Model 02 | NN + ReLU | ~87% | Faster | GPU |
| Model 03 | TinyVGG CNN | ~90%+ | Fastest | GPU |

## 🏗️ Model Architectures

### Model 01 - Baseline Neural Network
- Input Layer: 784 units (28x28 flattened images)
- Hidden Layer: 10 units
- Output Layer: 10 units (10 classes)
- Activation: None (Linear)

### Model 02 - Improved Neural Network
- Input Layer: 784 units
- Hidden Layer: 10 units with ReLU activation
- Output Layer: 10 units
- Optimizer: SGD (learning rate: 0.1)

### Model 03 - TinyVGG CNN
- **Conv Block 1**: 2x Conv2D layers (kernel=3, padding=1) + ReLU + MaxPool2D
- **Conv Block 2**: 2x Conv2D layers (kernel=3, padding=1) + ReLU + MaxPool2D
- **Classifier**: Flatten + Linear layer
- Hidden units: 10
- Significantly better performance on image data

## 💾 Model Saving

The best performing model (TinyVGG) is saved as:
```
model/TinyVGG_Computer_vison_model.pth
```

Load the model:
```python
loaded_model = FashionMNISTv3(input_shape=1, hidden_units=10, output_shape=10)
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model/TinyVGG_Computer_vison_model.pth'))
loaded_model.to(device)
```

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Primary metric for classification performance
- **Loss**: Cross-entropy loss for training/testing
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed per-class performance analysis
- **Training Time**: Comparison across different devices and architectures
